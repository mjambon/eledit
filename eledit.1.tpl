.TH ELEDIT 1 "Wed Jan 23, 2008" "INRIA"
.SH NAME
eledit \- line editor, version ELEDIT_VERSION

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B eledit
[-h \fIfile\fP]
[-x]
[-t]
[-l \fIlength\fP]
[-a | -u]
[\fIcommand options\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The command \fIeledit\fP allows to edit lines one by one when running an
interactive command. When typing a line, some keys with control or meta
are interpreted: it is possible to insert characters in the middle of
the line, go to the beginning or the end of the line, get a previous line,
search for a line with a pattern, etc.

.SH OPTIONS
The options are:
.TP
.B -h \fIfile\fP
Save the lines typed (history) in \fIfile\fP. The default is to have them
only in memory (so, they are lost at the end of the program).
.TP
.B -x
Extend the history file (given in option "-h") if it already exists. The
default is to truncate the history file.
.TP
.B -t
Display the sequences generated by the keys (for debugging).
.TP
.B -v
Print eledit version and exit.
.TP
.B -l \fIlength\fP
Tells that \fIlength\fP is the maximum line length displayed. If the
line edited is longer than this length, the line scrolls horizontally,
while editing. The default value is 70.
.TP
.B -a
Ascii encoding: characters whose code is greater than 128 are displayed
with a backslash followed by their code.
.TP
.B -u
Unicode encoding: the terminal must have been set in unicode mode. See
commands \fBunicode_start\fP and \fBunicode_stop\fP.
.TP
\fIcommand options\fP
Runs the command \fIcommand\fP and its possible options. This
must be the last option of eledit. The default value is "cat".

.SH KEYS BINDINGS
When eledit starts, some default key bindings are defined. The can be
completed with a "eleditrc" file. See the section \fBELEDITRC\fP.

In the following lines, the caret sign "^" means "control" and the
sequence "M-" means "meta" (either with the "meta" prefix, or by
pressing the "escape" key before). Examples:
.TP 1.0i
^a
press the "control" key, then press "a", then release "a", then
release "control".
.TP
M-a
press the "meta" key, then press "a", then release "a", then release
"meta", or: press and release the "escape" key, then press and release
"a" (the manipulation with "meta" may not work in some systems: in
this case, use the manipulation with "escape").
.PP

The default editing commands are:

.nf
      ^a   : beginning of line
      ^e   : end of line
      ^f   : forward char
      ^b   : backward char
      M-f  : forward word
      M-b  : backard word
      TAB  : complete file name
      ^p   : previous line in history
      ^n   : next line in history
      M-<  : first line in history
      M->  : last line in history
      ^r   : reverse search in history (see below)
      ^d   : delete char (or EOF if the line is empty)
      ^h   : (or backspace) backward delete char
      ^t   : transpose chars
      M-c  : capitalize word
      M-u  : upcase word
      M-l  : downcase word
      M-d  : kill word
      M-^h : (or M-del or M-backspace) backward kill word
      ^q   : insert next char
      M-/  : expand abbreviation
      ^k   : cut until end of line
      ^y   : paste
      ^u   : line discard
      ^l   : redraw current line
      ^g   : abort prefix
      ^c   : interrupt
      ^z   : suspend
      ^\\   : quit
      return : send line
      ^x     : send line and show next history line
      other  : insert char
.fi

The arrow keys can be used, providing your keyword returns standard key
sequences:

.nf
      up arrow    : previous line in history
      down arrow  : next line in history
      right arrow : forward char
      left arrow  : backward char
.fi

Other keys:

.nf
      home        : beginning of line
      end         : end of line
      delete      : delete char
      page up     : previous line in history
      page down   : next line in history
      shift home  : beginning of history
      shift end   : end of history
.fi

.SH REVERSE SEARCH
The reverse search in incremental, i.e. \fIeledit\fP backward searchs in the
history a line holding the characters typed. If you type "a", its search the
first line before the current line holding an "a" and displays it. If you then
type a "b", its search a line holding "ab", and so on. If you type ^h (or
backspace), it returns to the previous line found. To cancel the search,
type ^g. To find another line before holding the same string, type ^r.
To stop the editing and display the current line found, type "escape"
(other commands of the normal editing, different from ^h, ^g, and ^r stop
the editing too).

Summary of reverse search commands:

.nf
      ^g  : abort search
      ^r  : search previous same pattern
      ^h  : (or backspace) search without the last char
      del : search without the last char
      any other command : stop search and show the line found
.fi

.SH ELEDITRC
If the environment variable ELEDITRC is set, it contains the name of the
eleditrc file. Otherwise it is the file named ".eleditrc" in user's home
directory. When starting, eledit reads this file, if it exists, to modify
or complete the default bindings. If this file is changed while reading
lines, it is read again to take the new file into account.

Bindings lines are the ones which start with a string defining the key
sequence and follow with a colon and a binding. A binding is either a
string or a command. The other lines are ignored For example,the line:

.nf
    "\\C-a": beginning-of-line
.fi

binds the sequence "control-a" to the command "beginning-of-line".

The key sequence may contain the specific meta-sequences:

.nf
    \\C-   followed by a key: "control" of this key
    \\M-   followed by a key: "meta" of this key
    \\e    the "escape" key
    \\nnn  where nnn is one, two, or three octal digits, or:
    \\xnn  where nn is one or two hexadecimal digits:
            the binary representation of a byte
    \\a    bell = \\C-g
    \\b    backspace = \\C-h
    \\d    delete = \\277
    \\f    form feed = \\C-l
    \\n    newline = \\C-j
    \\r    carriage return = \\C-m
    \\t    tabulation = \\C-i
    \\v    vertical tabulation = \\C-k
.fi

  backward-char: move the cursor to the previous character
  backward-delete-char: delete the previous character
  backward-kill-word: delete the previous word

.SH KNOWN BUGS
If \fIeledit\fP has been launched in a shell script, the suspend command kills
it and its command... Use "exec eledit comm" instead of "eledit comm".
.br
The suspend command stops \fIeledit\fP but not the called program. Do not
do this if the called program is not waiting on standard input.
.br
In some systems (e.g. alpha), pasting two many characters works bad and
may block the terminal. Probably a kernel problem. No solution.
